# 🌦️ Weather App - Node.js Project

## 📚 Description

This is a simple Node.js weather application that allows users to get current weather information for any city they enter. The app fetches data from a public weather API and displays relevant information like temperature, weather conditions, and more.

The goal of this project is to practice using Node.js for backend development, handling HTTP requests, working with external APIs, and (optionally) integrating with a basic frontend.
